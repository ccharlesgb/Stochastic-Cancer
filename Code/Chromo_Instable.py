IDEA:
Set mutation rate to u_i = initial mutation rate
Model effect of a gene that causes chromosonal instability mutating as a step
function. Ie once this gene has mutated it causes u to go from u_i to u_f which
would be much higher.
Model at which cell type causes the worst increase in fixation time and by how
much.
